Edit and place Clickable Image Maps through easy to use shortcodes.

== Description ==

This is a plugin to help easily configure and display our clickable maps featuring MapHilight JQuery into a WordPress post or page. Each clickable area of our maps needs an active output url and this plugin includes a form to easily edit each of them. In addition there is a built in editor to configure the easyToolTip JQuery plugin and the MapHilight Configurations. 

Simply add the [shortcode] to the page and it's done and no real need to edit any code. Developers have complete access to the clickable map code and each map package also includes an editable photoshop image so that developers can redesign the default image design.

We have most all of the clickable maps of the world ready to download including the 50 states of the USA.

Our maps are primarily clickable maps with all the area coordinates and suitable for most html based websites.

My clickable maps are created at the advertised 'Fixed' size and are not resizeable.

We do not stock 'Flash' maps.
All our maps include editable photoshop format files to help you design your final image.

== Installation ==
1. Upload `image-map/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the Image Map Edit plugin page and configure your 'Customizations' settings.
4. Add your output links for each clickable area in the 'Set Button LInks' page.
5. Add the maps shortcode to your post or page e.g [image_map id=usa]

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Does the shortcode dispay the clickable map inside a widget?

No it doesn't, the maps display only in posts and pages.

Where can I get a Map of Australia for my WordPress dealers/agents page?

You can purchase from hundreds of clickable maps demonstrated at www.clickablemaps.net. All our maps have a free WordPress Plugin.
